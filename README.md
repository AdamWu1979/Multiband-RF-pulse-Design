# Multiband-RF-pulse-Design
A framework for designing RF pulse with multiband magnitude profile, arbitrary phase profile and generalized flip angle, using convex optimization. Spectral sparsity was exploited to further improve pulse performance, such as minimizing pulse duration, transition width and total energy with flexible trade-off.
