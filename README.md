# Multiband-RF-pulse-Design
This is a MATLAB toolbox for RF pulse design used in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). It features design of 1D selective RF pulse with multiband magnitude profile, arbitrary phase profile and generalized flip angle. The implementation is built on Shinnar-Le Roux (SLR) algorithm and convex optimization. Spectral sparsity was exploited to further improve pulse performance, such as minimizing pulse duration, transition width or total energy with flexible trade-off. 

Example designs of RF pulses for bSSFP C-13 MRI at 14T and a dualband saturation pulse for H-1 MRS at 3T were developed.

It is hosted on this open-source, collaborative platform in order to encourage everyone in the MRI research community to contribute tools that will help our field rapidly progress.
